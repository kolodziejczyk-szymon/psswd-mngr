SPA using Symfony API as a backend. You can register and login as well as add and delete accounts associated with your email address. The data is stored in MySQL db. In that project I'm utilizing Vuex for working with the backend and trying to keep everything organized and clean because of that. 

Project is unfinished and there's still many that I'm planning on fixing. The biggest one is the notification system. I like the idea of it, but I just need to think a little more what and where can I change and style it properly. 

When I was running the app locally I used XAMPP for db hosting and easy access to it.

## Project setup

Firstly you just need to run 
```
npm run serve
```
then you need to download: github.com/sadblondeboi/api

I'm planning on hosting these applications online so it's easy to see what is going on.
